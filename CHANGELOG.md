# Changelog

All notable changes to Nexus (formerly Tempo) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **CAT errors now name the actual fault instead of blaming the mode.** A failed mode change used to
  always read *"rig rejected PKTUSB"*, even when the real problem was the CAT connection. It now tells
  the three faults apart: *"can't reach the radio's CAT link"* when nothing is listening (rigctld or
  SmartSDR not running — the Windows `os error 10061` / *"target machine actively refused it"* case);
  *"no reply from the rig over CAT"* when the link is up but the radio never answers (rig off/asleep,
  wrong CAT port or model, serial baud mismatch, or SmartSDR not actually connected to the radio — the
  *"rig reply incomplete"* case); and *"rig rejected …"* only for a true rejection, where the radio
  answered but has no such mode (e.g. no DATA/PKT submode).

## [0.8.2] — 2026-07-13 — Settings declutter + upload/credential hardening

### Improved

- **Settings are much easier to navigate.** Every crowded screen is now grouped into labelled
  sub-sections: **Operating** (Transmit & Sequencing · Auto-CQ · Logging · Decoder · Housekeeping);
  **Logbook & QSL** (a section per service — LoTW · eQSL · QRZ · HamQTH · ClubLog · HRDLog ·
  Cloudlog); and **Integrations & Feeds** (Local Loggers · Spot Sources · Propagation). Rarely-touched
  Rig/CAT controls (CAT broker, Flex IP, Icom CI-V, rigctld port) and the phone-only FM knobs now sit
  behind collapsible **Advanced** / **Phone / FM** groups so the everyday settings aren't buried.

### Fixed

- **Auto-upload no longer drops a QSO on a network hiccup.** A transient failure (connection down,
  service busy) now re-queues just the connectors that failed and retries them — without re-sending
  the ones that already succeeded — instead of silently giving up. A definitive rejection (bad key)
  isn't retried, and a permanently-down service stops after 20 attempts.

### Security

- **The Cloudlog/Wavelog API key is now stored in the OS keychain**, not in `settings.json`. Any key
  saved by an earlier build is migrated into the keychain on first launch and scrubbed from the file;
  the Settings field is now write-only, matching every other credential.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-12 — Field Day run fix + audit hardening

A fast-follow after a full white-box QA + security audit of 0.8.0.

### Improved

- **Ultra-rare grids are now unmistakable.** An open-water (rover/maritime/DXpedition-only) grid gets
  a loud, glowing **💎 ULTRA** pill on the primary line of the Call Roster and in the band-activity
  feed — the old marker was a tiny ◆◆ that was easy to miss — and it now persists through the whole
  QSO, not just the CQ. Rare grids stay a quiet marker so the boards don't become confetti.
- **The Call Roster shows every reason a station is worth working.** It previously showed only the
  single top need; it now shows one chip per need form (new-DXCC, band, zone, grid…), matching the
  band-activity feed.
- **Focus returns to the callsign field after you log a contact** in the CW and Phone cockpits, so
  you can type the next call immediately (rapid logging / a Field Day run).
- **Settings are easier to navigate.** The two most overloaded screens are now grouped: **Operating**
  is split into Transmit & Sequencing / Auto-CQ & Caller Selection / Logging Behavior / Decoder /
  Station Housekeeping, and **Confirmations** is renamed **Logbook & QSL** with a section per service
  (LoTW · eQSL · QRZ · HamQTH · ClubLog · HRDLog · Cloudlog) — and Cloudlog is no longer stranded in
  the Field Day tab.

### Fixed

- **Field Day RUN mode now works a whole run.** A running station (calling CQ FD) worked exactly
  ONE contact and then went silent. It now returns to calling CQ after each logged QSO (and
  Search-&-Pounce returns to listening), so you can actually run a pileup.
- **A corrupt or crafted ADIF file can no longer crash the app.** A stray multibyte character in a
  date/time field, or a bogus field length, could panic or hang the log parser (taking TX/RX/CAT
  down until restart). Malformed records are now read safely — this covers imported logs and
  downloaded LoTW/eQSL reports.
- **A CAT-sharing client that drops mid-transmit now unkeys the rig.** If WSJT-X or N1MM crashed
  or closed while keyed through Nexus's rig broker, the radio could stay transmitting; a dropped
  broker connection now fail-safe unkeys.
- **CW stops cleanly on Monitor / TX-off** — queued CW no longer survives to key the rig when you
  re-enable transmit.
- **Completed QSOs aren't lost with "Auto-log QSOs" off** — the cockpit's Log QSO button now
  captures the finished contact instead of it being discarded.
- **Field Day Cabrillo export** stamps each QSO with its own band's frequency (a multi-band log
  used to write one frequency on every line).
- **Field Day log** no longer flags legal multi-band / multi-mode contacts of the same station as
  duplicates.
- **eQSL upload** failures are now labeled "eQSL" (they were mislabeled "QRZ").
- **Cloudlog / Wavelog upload** reports a real failure instead of a false "✓" when the instance
  rejects a record, and requires the API key + station id up front.
- **A "Spots" section you enable in Settings is now reachable** from the navigation rail.
- Assorted correctness: manual Field Day entry requires a valid ARRL/RAC section (no phantom
  multiplier); the WAS "by US state" stats and the "New state" needed-tag only count US contacts;
  "First DX" unlocks on your first foreign entity even before a domestic one; a manual rotor slew
  halts an active satellite track instead of fighting it; the "Contesting" setup goal lands on a
  reachable view; and the CW/Phone keyboard shortcuts read your live transmit-allowed state.

### Security

No critical or remotely-exploitable issues were found in the audit; these are defense-in-depth on
a single-user desktop app. Hardened the ADIF parser (UTF-8 char-boundary panic + integer-overflow
DoS), the LoTW upload temp file (unique unpredictable name, no symlink-follow, removed after use),
Cloudlog HTTPS + no-redirect enforcement (matching every other connector), and sanitized the band
value used in the debug period-WAV filename. Bumped `anyhow` to clear an advisory.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-12 — Field Day mode, readable light theme, and operating fixes

### Added

- **One-switch Field Day mode.** A single "Field Day mode" toggle in Settings turns on
  everything at once across Phone, CW, and digital — the Class+Section exchange, logging,
  scoring, dupe-checking, and the connectors. It's off (and completely invisible) the rest of
  the year, never turns itself on, and — once you enable it — survives a restart so a crash
  mid-event comes back operating with your log intact. Summer Field Day and Winter Field Day
  are selected automatically by date (with a manual override), each with its own rules.
- **Worked-sections board.** A colored ARRL/RAC section grid (all 83 sections, grouped by
  division) that lights up each section as you work it — see your coverage at a glance.
- **Club Log / N3FJP Field Day networking.** Nexus now logs into N3FJP using the contest-correct
  ENTER path (so your Class and Section actually score), and can report your band to the club's
  N3FJP network display without needing CAT on the N3FJP side.
- **CW Field Day macros** — new `{CLASS}` / `{SECTION}` / `{EXCH}` macro tokens send your
  exchange, plus a default Field Day macro set; a "Give: 3A WI" exchange prompt on Phone; and
  Winter-Field-Day operating from the Tempo chat cockpit.
- **Field Day exports** — one-page score summary and a dupe sheet alongside Cabrillo/ADIF, and a
  section-validated setup so you can't mistype your ARRL section.
- **Pop-out Field Day scoreboard** with a settable operator call that's passed straight through to
  N3FJP, plus timestamps on the Field Day call log and a larger Call/Class/Section entry.
- **Custom F-key macro profiles for CW** — save multiple named macro sets (per operator or per
  activity) and switch the active one from the CW cockpit; your existing macros become the
  "Default" profile automatically.
- **Roster is the default FT8/FT4 layout** (the friendlier at-a-glance view) — Classic is still
  one click away and your choice sticks.

### Changed

- **Light theme is much easier to read** — stronger surface hierarchy (panels lift off the page),
  softer off-white surfaces instead of harsh pure white, and clearer tables, chips, and status
  tints. Dark mode is unchanged.
- **Amber theme removed** — its monochrome palette flattened the color language; anyone on amber
  is moved to dark. (The amber-CRT *waterfall* color scheme stays.)

### Fixed

- **CW decode clears on QSY** — changing bands or clicking a Needed contact while operating CW
  now clears the CW decode window instead of leaving stale copy from the old frequency.
- **Two radios on one COM port now warns you** — configuring two radios on the same serial port
  (which left one showing a mysterious red status) now shows a clear "same COM port" message.
- **Light/Dark toggle now reachable in the Phone and CW views** — it was rendering but bunched to
  the left where it was easy to miss; it's now pinned to the top-right in every view.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-12 — Club Log upload enabled

### Added

- **Club Log realtime upload** is now active in the official builds — the app's developer
  API key is baked in, so you just add your own Club Log email + application password (and
  callsign if it differs) in Settings and enable auto-upload; each logged QSO is pushed to
  Club Log in real time. (The developer key is injected at build time and never committed to
  source, per Club Log's terms.)

### Fixed

- **The Field Day contest log now survives restarts.** Contacts are journaled to
  `fieldday_backup.adi` as they are logged and restored whenever you re-enter Field Day
  mode — a mid-event restart, crash, or Run ↔ Search-&-Pounce switch no longer clears the
  log or the dupe sheet. The journal carries real timestamps, so a recovered log still
  produces a valid Cabrillo entry. Entries from a previous event (over 4 days old) are
  not restored.
- **Settings can no longer be lost to a torn write.** The settings file is flushed to disk
  before the atomic swap, and a corrupt or unreadable `settings.json` (disk fault, hand
  edit, a virus scanner holding the file at startup) is preserved as
  `settings.json.corrupt` for recovery instead of being discarded. The app still starts
  from defaults in that case — re-check your callsign and license class — but your
  original settings can be recovered from the `.corrupt` file.
- **The Phone/CW scope now shows the right slice of the band on a native panadapter**
  (Flex SmartSDR / Icom CI-V). The view window was collapsing to a sliver ~100 kHz below
  the dial; it now centers on the dial with the CW zero-beat marker exactly on frequency,
  and the scope label reports the true RF span in MHz. Span and pitch changes also
  retarget the scope immediately instead of waiting for a re-open.
- **A dead audio stream no longer scrolls a frozen waterfall.** If the RX capture stops
  (device unplugged, DAX stream lost — e.g. RDP remote audio hiding the devices), the
  scope goes quiet instead of replaying the last captured row as phantom signals. A new
  Troubleshooting entry covers the RDP/DAX device-visibility case.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-12 — Optional 3-D WebGL Connect globe

### Added

- **3-D Connect globe (opt-in)** — a cinematic WebGL globe for the Connect map, toggled with
  the 🌐 button in the map header. A dark night-earth with dimmed city lights, a day/night
  terminator + greyline, atmosphere and bloom, band-colored clickable spots, and great-circle
  arcs to the stations you're working / that heard you.
- **Full layer parity in 3-D** — the same operating layers as the 2-D map, in the Layers
  panel: solar-flare blackout, aurora, MUF, proton polar cap, band-heat openings, CQ zones,
  range rings, coverage, your decodes, DXpeditions, US states, and the greyline.
- **Satellites with real 3-D orbits** — amateur birds actually orbit the globe at their true
  altitude, with footprint rings and live motion — not a flat ground track.
- **Automatic 3-D on capable machines** — on first run, PCs with a real GPU default to the
  3-D globe; low-end or software-rendered machines stay on the universal 2-D map. Your choice
  always overrides, and the 3-D engine is lazy-loaded so the 2-D default never pays for it.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-11 — AI CW decoder as primary, dual-radio TX-safety, operating polish

### Added

- **AI CW decoder is now THE decoder** — the neural-net (DeepCW) copy powers the CW
  cockpit's DECODE pane as a flowing transcript with a Clear button; dramatically better
  weak-signal copy. The CW copilot's call chips + guided next-step now read the AI copy.
  The classic decoder remains as the automatic fallback (and supplies the WPM estimate).
- **Customizable CW F-keys** — Settings ▸ Quick-reply Macros: edit each F1–F8 label +
  template (N1MM-style; {MYCALL}/{RST}/{NAME}, ! = worked call). Keys keep their roles, so
  the guided copilot's recommended-key highlight keeps working with custom text.
- **Waterfall pop-out** — tear the FT8 waterfall off into its own always-on-top window.
- **Resizable panels** — drag the FT8 waterfall height and the CW/Phone scope heights;
  sizes persist.
- **Live input spectrum in Settings audio** — confirms the right input device at a glance.
- **Band Scope pane for Connect** — the active radio's spectrum on the map screen.
- **Connect globe upgrade** — US state borders (read which state a spot or your QTH is in),
  a clear "you are here" QTH marker, and a moodier night-earth globe so the colored spots
  stand out. All in the universal 2D map (a high-fidelity 3D mode is planned for later).
- **Prominent band picker** — the CW/Phone band selector is now a large, band-colored
  control (matching the map's per-band spot colors) so your operating band reads at a glance.
- **Open-source compliance** — the DeepCW model's full AGPL-3.0 license text now ships with
  the installer (`resources/deepcw/`), and NOTICE credits the model and its corresponding
  source (e04/deepcw-engine) plus us-atlas for the runtime map data.

### Fixed

- **A stuck transmitter now recovers by itself.** A transient CAT failure could leave the
  radio keyed with the app unaware (TX/RX light on until a radio reboot). PTT tracking is
  now fail-safe, every teardown path force-unkeys, the native CI-V daemon sends a safety
  key-up as it closes, and an idle self-heal retries key-up until the radio acknowledges.
- **Tune on Icoms in SSB now makes RF** (DATA mode is engaged for the tune so the tone
  modulates; plain USB takes TX audio from the mic jack).
- Radio-switcher pill no longer flashes on a single slow poll; wedged native-CAT sessions
  no longer freeze the UI; several native-daemon robustness fixes.
- **Switching radios now moves control instantly.** A switch could leave the pill on the new
  radio while CAT kept commanding the old one for a while before catching up — the handoff
  no longer applies any change until it has fully taken over the new radio, so control
  follows the pill the moment you switch.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-07-11 — native panadapter (early access) + logger forwarding + watch list

### Added

- **Native Icom CI-V (early access, off by default)** — a per-radio toggle in Settings ▸ Rig
  for scope-capable Icoms (IC-7300 / 7610 / 9700 / 705 / 905) on a serial connection. Nexus
  drives the rig's CI-V directly instead of launching Hamlib's rigctld: the waterfall shows
  the radio's **real spectrum scope** ("CI-V RF" badge) instead of soundcard audio, and dial
  tracking becomes instant (the rig pushes frequency changes as you turn the knob). All CAT —
  frequency, mode (incl. USB-D for FT8), PTT, S-meter, power, CW keying, split, RIT, FM
  repeater duplex/tone — runs over the same native link. Requires the rig's CI-V USB baud at
  115200 for the scope stream (lower rates stay CAT-only). Turn the toggle off any time to
  return to the classic Hamlib path.
- **FlexRadio native panadapter** — when the active radio is a Flex (SmartSDR, network CAT)
  with its radio IP set, the waterfall streams the radio's true RF FFT ("FLEX RF" badge),
  with automatic fallback to the audio scope if the stream drops.
- **Watch list** — tell Nexus the calls, prefixes (`VP8*`), or entities you're hunting
  (Settings ▸ Alerts) and a decode or spot of one fires the loudest alert tier, above
  needed/new-DXCC.
- **N3FJP ACLog forwarding for everyday logging** — every QSO you log can now push to N3FJP
  ACLog in real time (not just Field Day), with duplicate protection.
- **Cloudlog / Wavelog forwarding** — log each QSO straight to your self-hosted
  Cloudlog/Wavelog instance (URL + station profile + API key in Settings ▸ Logging).
- **"My coverage" map layer** — shade the globe by where you've been heard/worked, by grid
  square or CQ zone, as a proper toggleable map layer with its own opacity.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-10 — dual-radio on-rig fixes

On-rig fixes from testing 0.5.0 with an FTDX10 + IC-9700 (HF + VHF on separate antennas).

### Fixed

- **Transmit worked on only one radio after switching.** After swinging to the other rig, its
  frequency and mode still tracked but PTT/transmit did nothing (it "keyed once, then never again").
  The switch adopted the radio's live background connection, which is opened read-only for
  monitoring — so it stayed in listen-only keying. The handoff now restores the radio's real PTT
  method (CAT / RTS / DTR) when it becomes active, and puts the radio you switched *away* from back
  into read-only monitoring.

### Added

- **Automatic band-routing.** Selecting a band (or typing a frequency) now switches to the radio
  configured for that band — pick 2 m and it moves to the VHF rig, pick an HF band and it swings
  back — instead of retuning whichever radio was active. A radio's explicit band list wins the bands
  it claims; a radio left with no band list is the catch-all for everything else. Turn on **peg-lock**
  in the top-bar switcher to pin the active radio and stop any auto-switching.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-10 — operating experience + dual-radio

Field-test-driven work on the day-to-day operating experience (waterfall fidelity, a prominent
frequency readout, dial latency, logbook scale) plus the start of true dual-radio support.

### Added

- **Dual-radio — run two rigs at once** (e.g. an HF radio + a VHF/UHF radio on separate antennas).
  Add a second radio in Settings ▸ Rig; a switcher appears in the top bar. Both rigs stay
  **permanently connected** — the non-active radio is monitored live (its frequency/S-meter show in
  the switcher) and switching is an instant **handoff** with no CAT teardown, so the dial never
  bounces. Invisible for single-radio stations (only a quiet "+ Add radio" button appears). Each
  radio has its own CAT/audio/rotator config and band-coverage set; daemon ports are auto-assigned
  distinct and auto-repaired on load.
- **Prominent, unified frequency readout** — a large, accent-colored MHz display shared across the
  digital, CW, and Phone cockpits; click to type an exact frequency.
- **Universal FFT waterfall** — every rig's audio scope now uses a real 4096-point FFT (~7.8 Hz/bin
  across 0–4000 Hz) instead of the old coarse filter bank, so even a Yaesu's soundcard waterfall
  resolves close signals.
- **Mouse-wheel tuning** — scroll over the scope **or the big frequency readout** to tune by the
  selected step (Shift = ×10); great for hunting CW/phone signals off the FTx default frequencies.
- **POTA park auto-load by reference** — type a park number in the log entry and its name/location
  fills in from the local index, with a live `api.pota.app` fallback.
- **Optional ADIF import at first-run** — the setup wizard now offers to import your existing log up
  front (skippable), so the needed/worked-before/awards intelligence works from day one.
- **Per-radio standard baud dropdown** in the Rig settings (1200–115,200) instead of free text.
- **Tune & Stop-TX controls in the Phone and CW cockpits** — a **Tune** button keys a steady carrier to
  tune an ATU or amplifier (auto-released by the TX watchdog), and **Stop TX** unkeys everything instantly
  (PTT, tune carrier, and CW keying). Restored — these were missing from the voice/CW cockpits.

### Changed

- **Fast dial tracking** — the rig's frequency is now polled on a short (~180 ms) sub-cadence,
  separate from the slower S-meter/mode/power reads, with transport-aware read deadlines, so the
  dial keeps up with the VFO knob (matching HRD-class responsiveness on Yaesu).
- **Mode changes keep the rig's filter width** — switching bands/modes no longer forces the rig's
  passband to its default (which was popping the Width display); explicit width changes still apply.
- **Logbook performance at 10k+ QSOs** — the logbook list is virtualized and its filter/sort
  memoized, so large logs scroll smoothly instead of lagging.

### Fixed

- **FTx Call Roster overlap** — need-chips (e.g. NewZone) no longer spill over the callsign, and the
  Call column fits longer calls like VE2OPR.
- **Settings-tab crash hardening** — audio/serial device enumeration is now panic-isolated, so a
  quirky/virtual device (some Flex DAX / RDP-remote-audio setups) can't crash the app when opening
  Settings.
- **Dual-radio CAT no longer dies on the background radio.** Saving a radio's config could leave the
  active radio and the monitored radio fighting over the same daemon port, so CAT went dead on whichever
  radio wasn't active — and flipped when you switched. The daemon port is now always re-synced after
  de-confliction, so CAT stays live on **both** radios in either direction.
- **Per-radio audio on rigs with a generic USB codec.** Two rigs that both enumerate as "USB Audio CODEC"
  are now listed as distinct entries ("USB Audio CODEC", "USB Audio CODEC #2"), so each radio can point at
  its own soundcard; previously both silently resolved to the first codec.
- **Radio soundcards that use 8-bit or 24-bit audio** (some Icom USB codecs) now open correctly for RX
  capture, TX, and the headphone monitor — they were failing with an "unsupported format" error.

_(Protocol decoders for a native FlexRadio panadapter and a per-radio native scope are in progress
behind the scenes; not yet user-visible.)_

## [0.4.1] — Phone / POTA / CAT punch-list

Field-test fixes and polish for voice/CW operating, park activations, and rig tuning.

### Added

- **POTA/SOTA logging** — a park/summit field in the log entry, an OTA column in the logbook, an
  activation mode that tags every QSO, and standard `SIG`/`SIG_INFO`/`SOTA_REF` ADIF.
- **Local POTA park search** — a bundled, refreshable park index for offline park lookup.
- **CAT tuning from the Phone/CW cockpits** — direct frequency entry, VFO up/down step tuning,
  RIT/XIT, and A/B VFO select (a Win4-style rig-control panel).

### Changed

- **De-FT8'd Phone & CW cockpits** — the top bar no longer shows FT8/digital furniture in voice/CW;
  each mode keeps its own controls. Sortable logbook columns; clearer hunt-chip visibility;
  smart-Enter QRZ lookup.
- **Smoother FTdx10 (and general rig) setup** — Auto-test seeds the detected model, with a callout
  when no model is set, and clearer rig hints.
- **Phone bandscope perf + clarity** — cached spectrum row, a you-are-here dial marker, a passband
  overlay, and honest labels.

### Fixed

- Auto-test wrong-model guard, park-prefill honesty, CSV BOM on export, and tuning-entry fixes from
  the review pass.

## [0.4.0] — band map, log stats, weak-signal CW, callbook photo, filter width

### Added

- **Vertical pop-out band map** — an N1MM-style frequency map of live cluster spots for the Phone
  and CW cockpits, colored by award need with worked calls struck through; click a spot to QSY to
  its exact frequency and prefill the log (including from the pop-out window).
- **Full-band activity strip** — a clickable spot strip spanning the whole band with a you-are-here
  dial marker; your licensed phone sub-band is shaded per US license class.
- **Logbook Statistics** — QSOs by band / mode / year / hour-of-day, top DXCC entities, WAS states,
  confirmation rate, plus continent, CQ-zone, and DX-vs-domestic breakdowns (cty.dat-resolved).
- **Weak-signal CW decode** — the decoder now gates on true SNR against off-pitch band noise, so the
  sensitivity slider genuinely trades copy against noise and the "E E E" storm between signals is gone.
- **Real CAT S-meter** — the Phone scope meter reads the rig's actual STRENGTH over CAT (S0–S9+60);
  shows "—" rather than faking a level when the rig doesn't report it or during TX.
- **RX filter-width control** — read/set the rig's passband over CAT from the Phone and CW cockpits
  (CW defaults narrow at 500 Hz to dig signals out of QRM).
- **Rig DSP toggles** — NB / NR / auto-notch on Phone and CW, plus COMP and VOX on Phone;
  capability-probed so only functions your rig reports are shown.
- **Manual split + sideband override on Phone** — one-click "work up N" split with an offset stepper,
  and a USB/LSB/FM override that reverts to the band-correct sideband on a band change.
- **Callbook photo + worked-before recall card** — the "B4" hint grew into a full recall panel:
  QRZ/HamQTH profile photo, prior contacts, distance/bearing from your QTH, and a same-band dupe flag.
- **Split RST fields** — separate Sent / Rcvd reports in the log entry (the CW decoder fills Rcvd).
- **Auto callbook lookup** — name/QTH fill shortly after you stop typing a call, no Tab needed.
- **Update check** — on launch (throttled to once a day) Nexus checks SourceForge for a newer
  release and shows a dismissible notice, with a manual check in Settings; it only opens the
  download page, never downloads or runs anything.

### Changed

- The redundant top-bar band dropdown (fed by the digital band plan, so a wrong-dial control on
  voice/CW) is hidden on Phone and CW; each cockpit keeps its own band picker.

### Fixed

- A periodic scope/passband stall: the slower CAT reads (mode, S-meter, DSP functions) are now
  staggered across poll cycles instead of stacking into one.
- The 4 m band (70.0–70.5 MHz) is now recognized by the UI band ranges, matching the backend plan.

## [0.3.0] — the Nexus transformation

**Tempo became Nexus.** What began as a chat-first app for the FT1/DX1 waveforms
is now an **all-mode amateur radio operations center**; the Tempo name lives on
as the FT1/DX1 chat layer inside it. Builds now ship as
`Nexus_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — the first versioned Nexus release.

### Added

- **FT8/FT4 operating tier with WSJT-X operational parity** — a five-phase
  program against a 207-row behavior matrix: the WSJT-X auto-sequencer state
  table (double-click semantics, sender lock, return-to-CQ, disable-after-73),
  early decode pass (11.8 s FT8 / 5.5 s FT4) + 2 s time-aligned late start,
  Split Operation (Rig / Fake It) with a single teardown drain, Hound mode with
  safe Fox-frame splitting, directed CQ, Tx1–Tx6 panel, WSJT-X keyboard
  shortcuts, F6 redecode, decode depth/passband controls, logbook hash-table
  seeding, Classic ↔ Roster layout toggle, and chronological bottom-pinned Band
  Activity with period separators.
- **Full WSJT-X UDP ecosystem surface** — outbound Heartbeat/Status/Decode/
  QsoLogged and inbound Reply, HaltTx, Clear, Replay, Location,
  HighlightCallsign, using the canonical NetworkMessage.hpp type numbers
  (pinned by test); JTAlert and GridTracker interop verified. Plus **Companion
  mode** (ride an upstream WSJT-X/JTDX decode stream) and a **rigctld-compatible
  CAT broker** so other shack software shares the radio through Nexus.
- **CW cockpit** — CAT (`send_morse`) and soundcard keyer back-ends, 5–50 WPM
  with on-the-fly nudge, eight token-expanding macros, zero-beat scope,
  automatic rig-mode policy, license-privilege TX gating, 599-default logging.
- **Phone cockpit** — live dial read-back, band-correct sideband policy, fast
  colored bandscope, spacebar/button/rig PTT with stuck-TX safeties, six-slot
  voice keyer (record/import WAV), crash-safe QSO recording, RF power control.
- **Needed board 2.0** — eight need types ranked by award value with a per-row
  **evidence line** ("heard by K9LC (EN52, 26 km), 4 min ago"), corroboration
  gates (near-receiver geometry, VHF two-receiver rule, Es-patch locality),
  persisted filters, atomic one-click work with cluster split-comment parsing
  ("UP 2" → rig split), and a pop-out second-monitor window.
- **POTA/SOTA hunter** — live activator spots, NEW PARK and BAND OPEN badges,
  one-click HUNT (QSY + cockpit + pending park tag with a 4 h TTL and base-call
  matching) writing standard `SIG`/`SIG_INFO`/`SOTA_REF` ADIF.
- **Field Day event mode** — ARRL FD + Winter FD with correct date rules and
  scoring (per-mode points, dupes per band per mode, legal power tiers, bonus
  checklist), all-mode event logging from the CW/Phone cockpits, band-follows-
  QSY, submittable Cabrillo 3.0/ADIF, **real-time N3FJP push** over the official
  TCP API (with Test button) and **native N1MM+ `<contactinfo>` broadcast**.
- **Logbook, awards & connectors** — ADIF 3.1.4 round-trip logbook; offline
  DXCC / Challenge / Honor Roll / WAS / WAZ from cty.dat; **source-aware
  confirmations** (eQSL never counts toward LoTW-grade awards); LoTW TQSL-signed
  upload + two-pull incremental confirmation sync over direct HTTPS; QRZ callbook
  autofill + logbook push + Test; ClubLog (bring your own free API key) and eQSL
  connectors; per-QSO upload state machine persisted in ADIF;
  prior-QSO history panel; credentials exclusively in the OS keychain; and the
  local-only **Journey** achievement layer.
- **Connect** — three-projection world map (3-D globe / azimuthal beam / flat)
  with 12 layers, intent presets, hover/click/double-click-to-work; an
  operator-anchored **opening detector** with reciprocity gates and Es/F2/
  aurora/tropo classification; band advisor; getting-out panel; NOAA space
  weather; and the persistent Now-Bar with feed-health pills.
- **Zero-config setup** — **Detect my radio** (USB descriptor → rig model +
  driver hint + paired audio CODEC), goal-driven first-run wizard, license-class
  transmit lockout (FCC Part 97 sub-bands incl. the 2026 60 m rules), DAG-
  validated feature registry, detached panel windows, NTP slot-grid steering.

### Changed

- **App renamed Tempo → Nexus**; repository moved to `kd9taw/nexus`.
- FT8/FT4 is now the production tier; FT1/DX1 remain beta pending on-air
  validation (unchanged honest framing).
- Field Log merged into the Field Day workspace; the Logbook is the single log.

### Removed

- **SuperFox** — investigated and abandoned: the WSJT-X QPC table file is
  licensed "only for use with WSJT-X", which bars vendoring. Hound remains.
- **Broadcasts section** — removed from the UI (the underlying announce/Roam
  machinery remains for Coordinated QSY).

### Fixed

- PSK Reporter uploads declared the mode string under IPFIX enterprise field 7
  (iMD — a PSK31 distortion metric) instead of field 10 (mode), so every spot
  arrived modeless and pskreporter.info displayed its default, PSK31 — FT8
  decodes showed up as "PSK31" on FT8 frequencies. Field id corrected to match
  WSJT-X's PSKReporter.cpp; spots now carry FT8/FT4/FT1/DX1 correctly.
- WSJT-X UDP message type numbers were shifted +1 for types ≥ 8 (a real JTAlert
  FreeText datagram parsed as HaltTx and killed TX) — now canonical and pinned.
- FT4 transmitted at slot +0.0 s instead of the standard +0.5 s timing.
- Split restore could strand a shifted VFO through the UDP HaltTx and tune
  paths; Rig split could latch VFO B.
- Field Day log band was frozen at event entry — post-QSY contacts exported
  with the wrong band and corrupted dupe checking.
- Winter Field Day date math used "last Saturday of January", a week late in
  years like 2026 — now "last full weekend".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-03

This is a **beta / pre-release**: everything below is simulation- and
Windows-cross-build-validated, **not yet proven on the air**. On-air
decode-rate-vs-SNR remains the open gate.

### Added

- **IR-HARQ is live end-to-end.** The incremental-redundancy retransmission
  combiner — previously designed-but-dormant (simulation-only) — now runs
  through the full live pipeline and is **on by default**. A frame that fails
  to decode standalone (RV0) is buffered and **joint-turbo-combined** with its
  retransmissions: RV0 carries the base 174 bits; RV1/RV2 each carry 87 new
  punctured LDPC(348,91) parity + 87 repeated systematic, each with a distinct
  Costas sync (RV0 `[0,2,3,1]`, RV1 `[1,3,2,0]`, RV2 `[3,0,2,1]`). Slot expiry
  30 s, freq tolerance +-10 Hz. A coherent CPM-Costas discriminator
  (`ft1_rv_detect`) identifies the RV (>99% accurate, <1% false to -11 dB),
  and the QSO sequencer drives RV escalation (0->1->2 on implicit NAK, reset on
  implicit ACK). Simulated (AWGN/fading sweeps): combiner **+1.3 dB** AWGN and **+3.2 dB** under
  1 Hz / 1 ms fading (3-TX); through the full live pipeline ~**+2.5 dB**
  threshold shift and ~**2x QSO completion** in the -11..-13 dB zone. UI adds a
  **HARQ.RVn decode badge**, a **HARQ on/off toggle** (default on), and a
  **session rescue counter**; `Decode.rv` reports how many RVs were combined.
- **DX1 full-passband acquisition.** DX1 RX now decodes **every** signal across
  200-2900 Hz per slot (like FT1's Costas search) instead of a single carrier
  at the tuned RX offset; `rx_offset_hz` is demoted to a waterfall marker /
  TX-pairing hint. Three-stage scan: a coarse chirp-correlation carrier sweep
  (12.5 Hz grid, pre-folded replicas, trig-free hot loop) -> median-threshold
  peak-pick -> full CRC-14-gated decode per survivor. ~3-4 s/slot.
- **Transmit period (Tx 1st / Tx 2nd).** Choose whether you transmit on the even
  ("1st") or odd ("2nd") T/R slots — like WSJT-X's "Tx even/1st". A top-bar
  toggle + a Settings mirror; persisted. (Two stations must pick opposite
  periods to complete a QSO — previously TX was hardcoded to even, which is why
  QSO timing "felt off".)
- **Click-to-tune waterfall.** Click the waterfall to set your **RX** audio
  offset (green marker); shift-click sets **TX** (red marker), with a **Hold Tx**
  toggle to keep TX fixed. FT1 transmits at the chosen offset and hears the whole
  band; DX1 decodes at your tuned offset. The waterfall now marks **real** decoded
  signals at their audio frequencies.
- **Live clock-offset check (NTP).** Tempo periodically queries an NTP server and
  shows your real PC-clock-vs-UTC offset in the top bar (e.g. "clock +0.3 s"),
  warning when it drifts past the slot tolerance. On by default; fails silently
  off-grid and can be disabled in Settings.
- **Operator manual + visual launch surface.** A full operator manual in
  [docs/manual/](docs/manual/) (Getting Started, Operating Guide, Rig & Audio
  Setup, Frequency Plan, Tiers, Building, FAQ, Troubleshooting, Architecture,
  Roadmap), a screenshot-rich README with a hero banner and an animated demo
  GIF, a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a `SUPPORT.md`, an on-air-report issue template,
  and enabled Discussions for on-air reports.

- **Tempo band plan + frequency controls.** Dedicated, US-General-legal and
  CW-clear calling frequencies across HF and VHF/UHF (USB weak-signal + FM
  simplex), placed clear of the FT8/FT4/JS8/WSPR/PSK watering holes and the FM
  national calling / APRS / satellite / repeater segments — see
  [docs/FREQUENCIES.md](docs/FREQUENCIES.md). New one-tap **band selector** and
  **manual frequency entry** in the top bar and Settings, retuning the rig live.
- **On-air operating controls** (from a WSJT-X gap audit): RX **input-level
  meter** + **Tx power** + **audio-device selection**; **Tune** (key a carrier),
  **Monitor** (RX-only) and **Stop TX**; DT-derived **time-sync health**; and a
  **Tx watchdog** auto-stop.
- **Windows cross-build validated.** All modem self-tests, `tempo.exe`, and the
  NSIS installer cross-build clean, and **5/5 Windows test exes pass** (FT1
  -15 dB, DX1 -18.6 dB, the 3-signal full-band scan, and FT1 acquisition +
  IR-HARQ `rv` through the C-ABI). Test exes now **statically link the gfortran
  runtime**, so they are self-contained.
- **Work a station + ADIF logbook.** Click a heard station (or a decode) to start
  a directed QSO with them; a persistent **ADIF logbook** (`log.adi`) that
  auto-logs completed QSOs and powers **worked-before (B4)** highlighting, with a
  manual Log-QSO form; inbound WSJT-X **Reply** (GridTracker/JTAlert
  double-click-to-call) now drives Tempo.
- **Live decode feed + alerts + comforts.** A color-coded WSJT-X-style decode
  list (CQ / directed-to-you / worked / new); **audio + visual alerts** on your
  call / CQ / new station; a **UTC clock** and great-circle **bearing**; and
  **editable quick-reply macros**.

### Changed

- **Starts passive (hunt-and-pounce).** Tempo no longer auto-calls CQ on startup;
  the presence beacon is an opt-in setting (default off), so the app listens and
  only transmits when the operator acts.

### Fixed

- **CAT now connects when you Save.** The radio loop read the rig/PTT config only
  once at startup, so choosing a rig in Settings did nothing until a full restart
  (and the VOX default never launched rigctld). It now applies rig/PTT/audio
  changes live — rebuilding the rig and launching rigctld the moment you save.
- **Test CAT.** New WSJT-X-style **Test CAT** button (Settings → Rig Control):
  opens the rig, reads its frequency, and reports green (with the frequency) or a
  specific error. A live rig/CAT status and an audio-device error are now shown
  in the app instead of failing silently to a hidden console.
- **Waterfall shows live receive audio.** The spectrum was computed from the
  decoder's once-per-slot frame (blank before the first decode, frozen during TX);
  it now reflects the continuously-captured sound-card input every cycle.
- **Tune** keys through the connected CAT rig (previously a VOX no-op on the
  startup snapshot) and auto-releases after 12 s as a safety.
- Installed app could fall back to the in-browser demo mock (fake stations / QSOs)
  if the Tauri backend wasn't detected; it now always uses the real engine.

## [0.1.0] - TBD

Initial pre-release. This is an **unreleased beta**: the protocol and tooling
are simulation-validated but have not been proven on the air, and the published
Windows binaries are cross-compiled. Treat this build as experimental.

### Added

- **Fast tier (FT1).** 4-CPM turbo modem with IR-HARQ, 4 s T/R, coherent.
  AWGN 50%-decode threshold of roughly -15 dB in simulation.
- **Robust tier (DX1).** Non-coherent 8-FSK with soft-decision LDPC(174,91),
  15 s T/R, fading-resilient. AWGN 50% near -18.6 dB with about a 3.7 dB fading
  penalty in simulation. Operator-visible tier toggle; the tier is never
  switched silently. Both tiers carry the same 77-bit messages, so all
  operating modes work on either.
- **Chat-first UI.** Vite + React + TypeScript desktop UI with three themes
  (Light, Dark, and night-vision-safe Amber-Night) and a modernized waterfall.
- **Operating modes.** Chat, QSO (run / monitor), and Field Day (run / S&P),
  driven by the headless-testable TX/RX engine in `tempo-app`.
- **Presence and messaging.** Passive roster built from decodes, free-text
  chunking and reassembly, a directed inbox, and presence-gated
  store-and-forward for off-grid nets.
- **Open broadcast and band feed.** To-all free-text broadcasts plus a band
  feed of decoded traffic.
- **Rig control.** PTT/CAT via Hamlib `rigctld` (launched by Tempo, default
  TCP `127.0.0.1:4532`), direct serial keying on the RTS or DTR line, or VOX
  for rigs without CAT.
- **WSJT-X UDP API.** WSJT-X-compatible UDP interface (magic `0xADBCCBDA`,
  schema 3, default `127.0.0.1:2237`; also listens for Reply / HaltTx /
  FreeText), with PSK Reporter spotting (outbound UDP to
  `report.pskreporter.info:4739`).
- **Windows installer.** NSIS `Tempo_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (per-user install)
  bundling the offline WebView2 runtime and Hamlib (`rigctld` + DLLs) so it
  installs clean and CAT works offline.
- **Build scripts.** Native Windows build (`scripts/build-windows.sh` for MSYS2
  UCRT64, with the `scripts/build-windows.ps1` PowerShell wrapper) and
  Linux/WSL2 cross-compile (`scripts/build-windows-cross.sh`), plus
  `scripts/fetch-hamlib.sh` to stage the bundled Hamlib.

### Known limitations

- On-air validation is pending; all performance figures above are from
  simulation only.
- The FT8/FT4 tier is Phase 2 — the internals are compiled in libft1, but no
  decode pipeline is wired up yet.
- Published Windows binaries are cross-compiled and should be treated as beta.
