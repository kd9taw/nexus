# Changelog

All notable changes to Nexus (formerly Tempo) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] — the Nexus transformation

**Tempo became Nexus.** What began as a chat-first app for the FT1/DX1 waveforms
is now an **all-mode amateur radio operations center**; the Tempo name lives on
as the FT1/DX1 chat layer inside it. Builds now ship as
`Nexus_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — the first versioned Nexus release.

### Added

- **FT8/FT4 operating tier with WSJT-X operational parity** — a five-phase
  program against a 207-row behavior matrix: the WSJT-X auto-sequencer state
  table (double-click semantics, sender lock, return-to-CQ, disable-after-73),
  early decode pass (11.8 s FT8 / 5.5 s FT4) + 2 s time-aligned late start,
  Split Operation (Rig / Fake It) with a single teardown drain, Hound mode with
  safe Fox-frame splitting, directed CQ, Tx1–Tx6 panel, WSJT-X keyboard
  shortcuts, F6 redecode, decode depth/passband controls, logbook hash-table
  seeding, Classic ↔ Roster layout toggle, and chronological bottom-pinned Band
  Activity with period separators.
- **Full WSJT-X UDP ecosystem surface** — outbound Heartbeat/Status/Decode/
  QsoLogged and inbound Reply, HaltTx, Clear, Replay, Location,
  HighlightCallsign, using the canonical NetworkMessage.hpp type numbers
  (pinned by test); JTAlert and GridTracker interop verified. Plus **Companion
  mode** (ride an upstream WSJT-X/JTDX decode stream) and a **rigctld-compatible
  CAT broker** so other shack software shares the radio through Nexus.
- **CW cockpit** — CAT (`send_morse`) and soundcard keyer back-ends, 5–50 WPM
  with on-the-fly nudge, eight token-expanding macros, zero-beat scope,
  automatic rig-mode policy, license-privilege TX gating, 599-default logging.
- **Phone cockpit** — live dial read-back, band-correct sideband policy, fast
  colored bandscope, spacebar/button/rig PTT with stuck-TX safeties, six-slot
  voice keyer (record/import WAV), crash-safe QSO recording, RF power control.
- **Needed board 2.0** — eight need types ranked by award value with a per-row
  **evidence line** ("heard by K9LC (EN52, 26 km), 4 min ago"), corroboration
  gates (near-receiver geometry, VHF two-receiver rule, Es-patch locality),
  persisted filters, atomic one-click work with cluster split-comment parsing
  ("UP 2" → rig split), and a pop-out second-monitor window.
- **POTA/SOTA hunter** — live activator spots, NEW PARK and BAND OPEN badges,
  one-click HUNT (QSY + cockpit + pending park tag with a 4 h TTL and base-call
  matching) writing standard `SIG`/`SIG_INFO`/`SOTA_REF` ADIF.
- **Field Day event mode** — ARRL FD + Winter FD with correct date rules and
  scoring (per-mode points, dupes per band per mode, legal power tiers, bonus
  checklist), all-mode event logging from the CW/Phone cockpits, band-follows-
  QSY, submittable Cabrillo 3.0/ADIF, **real-time N3FJP push** over the official
  TCP API (with Test button) and **native N1MM+ `<contactinfo>` broadcast**.
- **Logbook, awards & connectors** — ADIF 3.1.4 round-trip logbook; offline
  DXCC / Challenge / Honor Roll / WAS / WAZ from cty.dat; **source-aware
  confirmations** (eQSL never counts toward LoTW-grade awards); LoTW TQSL-signed
  upload + two-pull incremental confirmation sync over direct HTTPS; QRZ callbook
  autofill + logbook push + Test; ClubLog (bring your own free API key) and eQSL
  connectors; per-QSO upload state machine persisted in ADIF;
  prior-QSO history panel; credentials exclusively in the OS keychain; and the
  local-only **Journey** achievement layer.
- **Connect** — three-projection world map (3-D globe / azimuthal beam / flat)
  with 12 layers, intent presets, hover/click/double-click-to-work; an
  operator-anchored **opening detector** with reciprocity gates and Es/F2/
  aurora/tropo classification; band advisor; getting-out panel; NOAA space
  weather; and the persistent Now-Bar with feed-health pills.
- **Zero-config setup** — **Detect my radio** (USB descriptor → rig model +
  driver hint + paired audio CODEC), goal-driven first-run wizard, license-class
  transmit lockout (FCC Part 97 sub-bands incl. the 2026 60 m rules), DAG-
  validated feature registry, detached panel windows, NTP slot-grid steering.

### Changed

- **App renamed Tempo → Nexus**; repository moved to `kd9taw/nexus`.
- FT8/FT4 is now the production tier; FT1/DX1 remain beta pending on-air
  validation (unchanged honest framing).
- Field Log merged into the Field Day workspace; the Logbook is the single log.

### Removed

- **SuperFox** — investigated and abandoned: the WSJT-X QPC table file is
  licensed "only for use with WSJT-X", which bars vendoring. Hound remains.
- **Broadcasts section** — removed from the UI (the underlying announce/Roam
  machinery remains for Coordinated QSY).

### Fixed

- WSJT-X UDP message type numbers were shifted +1 for types ≥ 8 (a real JTAlert
  FreeText datagram parsed as HaltTx and killed TX) — now canonical and pinned.
- FT4 transmitted at slot +0.0 s instead of the standard +0.5 s timing.
- Split restore could strand a shifted VFO through the UDP HaltTx and tune
  paths; Rig split could latch VFO B.
- Field Day log band was frozen at event entry — post-QSY contacts exported
  with the wrong band and corrupted dupe checking.
- Winter Field Day date math used "last Saturday of January", a week late in
  years like 2026 — now "last full weekend".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-03

This is a **beta / pre-release**: everything below is simulation- and
Windows-cross-build-validated, **not yet proven on the air**. On-air
decode-rate-vs-SNR remains the open gate.

### Added

- **IR-HARQ is live end-to-end.** The incremental-redundancy retransmission
  combiner — previously designed-but-dormant (simulation-only) — now runs
  through the full live pipeline and is **on by default**. A frame that fails
  to decode standalone (RV0) is buffered and **joint-turbo-combined** with its
  retransmissions: RV0 carries the base 174 bits; RV1/RV2 each carry 87 new
  punctured LDPC(348,91) parity + 87 repeated systematic, each with a distinct
  Costas sync (RV0 `[0,2,3,1]`, RV1 `[1,3,2,0]`, RV2 `[3,0,2,1]`). Slot expiry
  30 s, freq tolerance +-10 Hz. A coherent CPM-Costas discriminator
  (`ft1_rv_detect`) identifies the RV (>99% accurate, <1% false to -11 dB),
  and the QSO sequencer drives RV escalation (0->1->2 on implicit NAK, reset on
  implicit ACK). Measured: combiner **+1.3 dB** AWGN and **+3.2 dB** under
  1 Hz / 1 ms fading (3-TX); through the full live pipeline ~**+2.5 dB**
  threshold shift and ~**2x QSO completion** in the -11..-13 dB zone. UI adds a
  **HARQ.RVn decode badge**, a **HARQ on/off toggle** (default on), and a
  **session rescue counter**; `Decode.rv` reports how many RVs were combined.
- **DX1 full-passband acquisition.** DX1 RX now decodes **every** signal across
  200-2900 Hz per slot (like FT1's Costas search) instead of a single carrier
  at the tuned RX offset; `rx_offset_hz` is demoted to a waterfall marker /
  TX-pairing hint. Three-stage scan: a coarse chirp-correlation carrier sweep
  (12.5 Hz grid, pre-folded replicas, trig-free hot loop) -> median-threshold
  peak-pick -> full CRC-14-gated decode per survivor. ~3-4 s/slot.
- **Transmit period (Tx 1st / Tx 2nd).** Choose whether you transmit on the even
  ("1st") or odd ("2nd") T/R slots — like WSJT-X's "Tx even/1st". A top-bar
  toggle + a Settings mirror; persisted. (Two stations must pick opposite
  periods to complete a QSO — previously TX was hardcoded to even, which is why
  QSO timing "felt off".)
- **Click-to-tune waterfall.** Click the waterfall to set your **RX** audio
  offset (green marker); shift-click sets **TX** (red marker), with a **Hold Tx**
  toggle to keep TX fixed. FT1 transmits at the chosen offset and hears the whole
  band; DX1 decodes at your tuned offset. The waterfall now marks **real** decoded
  signals at their audio frequencies.
- **Live clock-offset check (NTP).** Tempo periodically queries an NTP server and
  shows your real PC-clock-vs-UTC offset in the top bar (e.g. "clock +0.3 s"),
  warning when it drifts past the slot tolerance. On by default; fails silently
  off-grid and can be disabled in Settings.
- **Operator manual + visual launch surface.** A full operator manual in
  [docs/manual/](docs/manual/) (Getting Started, Operating Guide, Rig & Audio
  Setup, Frequency Plan, Tiers, Building, FAQ, Troubleshooting, Architecture,
  Roadmap), a screenshot-rich README with a hero banner and an animated demo
  GIF, a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a `SUPPORT.md`, an on-air-report issue template,
  and enabled Discussions for on-air reports.

- **Tempo band plan + frequency controls.** Dedicated, US-General-legal and
  CW-clear calling frequencies across HF and VHF/UHF (USB weak-signal + FM
  simplex), placed clear of the FT8/FT4/JS8/WSPR/PSK watering holes and the FM
  national calling / APRS / satellite / repeater segments — see
  [docs/FREQUENCIES.md](docs/FREQUENCIES.md). New one-tap **band selector** and
  **manual frequency entry** in the top bar and Settings, retuning the rig live.
- **On-air operating controls** (from a WSJT-X gap audit): RX **input-level
  meter** + **Tx power** + **audio-device selection**; **Tune** (key a carrier),
  **Monitor** (RX-only) and **Stop TX**; DT-derived **time-sync health**; and a
  **Tx watchdog** auto-stop.
- **Windows cross-build validated.** All modem self-tests, `tempo.exe`, and the
  NSIS installer cross-build clean, and **5/5 Windows test exes pass** (FT1
  -15 dB, DX1 -18.6 dB, the 3-signal full-band scan, and FT1 acquisition +
  IR-HARQ `rv` through the C-ABI). Test exes now **statically link the gfortran
  runtime**, so they are self-contained.
- **Work a station + ADIF logbook.** Click a heard station (or a decode) to start
  a directed QSO with them; a persistent **ADIF logbook** (`log.adi`) that
  auto-logs completed QSOs and powers **worked-before (B4)** highlighting, with a
  manual Log-QSO form; inbound WSJT-X **Reply** (GridTracker/JTAlert
  double-click-to-call) now drives Tempo.
- **Live decode feed + alerts + comforts.** A color-coded WSJT-X-style decode
  list (CQ / directed-to-you / worked / new); **audio + visual alerts** on your
  call / CQ / new station; a **UTC clock** and great-circle **bearing**; and
  **editable quick-reply macros**.

### Changed

- **Starts passive (hunt-and-pounce).** Tempo no longer auto-calls CQ on startup;
  the presence beacon is an opt-in setting (default off), so the app listens and
  only transmits when the operator acts.

### Fixed

- **CAT now connects when you Save.** The radio loop read the rig/PTT config only
  once at startup, so choosing a rig in Settings did nothing until a full restart
  (and the VOX default never launched rigctld). It now applies rig/PTT/audio
  changes live — rebuilding the rig and launching rigctld the moment you save.
- **Test CAT.** New WSJT-X-style **Test CAT** button (Settings → Rig Control):
  opens the rig, reads its frequency, and reports green (with the frequency) or a
  specific error. A live rig/CAT status and an audio-device error are now shown
  in the app instead of failing silently to a hidden console.
- **Waterfall shows live receive audio.** The spectrum was computed from the
  decoder's once-per-slot frame (blank before the first decode, frozen during TX);
  it now reflects the continuously-captured sound-card input every cycle.
- **Tune** keys through the connected CAT rig (previously a VOX no-op on the
  startup snapshot) and auto-releases after 12 s as a safety.
- Installed app could fall back to the in-browser demo mock (fake stations / QSOs)
  if the Tauri backend wasn't detected; it now always uses the real engine.

## [0.1.0] - TBD

Initial pre-release. This is an **unreleased beta**: the protocol and tooling
are simulation-validated but have not been proven on the air, and the published
Windows binaries are cross-compiled. Treat this build as experimental.

### Added

- **Fast tier (FT1).** 4-CPM turbo modem with IR-HARQ, 4 s T/R, coherent.
  AWGN 50%-decode threshold of roughly -15 dB in simulation.
- **Robust tier (DX1).** Non-coherent 8-FSK with soft-decision LDPC(174,91),
  15 s T/R, fading-resilient. AWGN 50% near -18.6 dB with about a 3.7 dB fading
  penalty in simulation. Operator-visible tier toggle; the tier is never
  switched silently. Both tiers carry the same 77-bit messages, so all
  operating modes work on either.
- **Chat-first UI.** Vite + React + TypeScript desktop UI with three themes
  (Light, Dark, and night-vision-safe Amber-Night) and a modernized waterfall.
- **Operating modes.** Chat, QSO (run / monitor), and Field Day (run / S&P),
  driven by the headless-testable TX/RX engine in `tempo-app`.
- **Presence and messaging.** Passive roster built from decodes, free-text
  chunking and reassembly, a directed inbox, and presence-gated
  store-and-forward for off-grid nets.
- **Open broadcast and band feed.** To-all free-text broadcasts plus a band
  feed of decoded traffic.
- **Rig control.** PTT/CAT via Hamlib `rigctld` (launched by Tempo, default
  TCP `127.0.0.1:4532`), direct serial keying on the RTS or DTR line, or VOX
  for rigs without CAT.
- **WSJT-X UDP API.** WSJT-X-compatible UDP interface (magic `0xADBCCBDA`,
  schema 3, default `127.0.0.1:2237`; also listens for Reply / HaltTx /
  FreeText), with PSK Reporter spotting (outbound UDP to
  `report.pskreporter.info:4739`).
- **Windows installer.** NSIS `Tempo_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (per-user install)
  bundling the offline WebView2 runtime and Hamlib (`rigctld` + DLLs) so it
  installs clean and CAT works offline.
- **Build scripts.** Native Windows build (`scripts/build-windows.sh` for MSYS2
  UCRT64, with the `scripts/build-windows.ps1` PowerShell wrapper) and
  Linux/WSL2 cross-compile (`scripts/build-windows-cross.sh`), plus
  `scripts/fetch-hamlib.sh` to stage the bundled Hamlib.

### Known limitations

- On-air validation is pending; all performance figures above are from
  simulation only.
- The FT8/FT4 tier is Phase 2 — the internals are compiled in libft1, but no
  decode pipeline is wired up yet.
- Published Windows binaries are cross-compiled and should be treated as beta.
