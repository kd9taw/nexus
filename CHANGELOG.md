# Changelog

All notable changes to Nexus (formerly Tempo) are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-10 — operating experience + dual-radio

Field-test-driven work on the day-to-day operating experience (waterfall fidelity, a prominent
frequency readout, dial latency, logbook scale) plus the start of true dual-radio support.

### Added

- **Dual-radio — run two rigs at once** (e.g. an HF radio + a VHF/UHF radio on separate antennas).
  Add a second radio in Settings ▸ Rig; a switcher appears in the top bar. Both rigs stay
  **permanently connected** — the non-active radio is monitored live (its frequency/S-meter show in
  the switcher) and switching is an instant **handoff** with no CAT teardown, so the dial never
  bounces. Invisible for single-radio stations (only a quiet "+ Add radio" button appears). Each
  radio has its own CAT/audio/rotator config and band-coverage set; daemon ports are auto-assigned
  distinct and auto-repaired on load.
- **Prominent, unified frequency readout** — a large, accent-colored MHz display shared across the
  digital, CW, and Phone cockpits; click to type an exact frequency.
- **Universal FFT waterfall** — every rig's audio scope now uses a real 4096-point FFT (~7.8 Hz/bin
  across 0–4000 Hz) instead of the old coarse filter bank, so even a Yaesu's soundcard waterfall
  resolves close signals.
- **Mouse-wheel tuning** — scroll over the scope **or the big frequency readout** to tune by the
  selected step (Shift = ×10); great for hunting CW/phone signals off the FTx default frequencies.
- **POTA park auto-load by reference** — type a park number in the log entry and its name/location
  fills in from the local index, with a live `api.pota.app` fallback.
- **Optional ADIF import at first-run** — the setup wizard now offers to import your existing log up
  front (skippable), so the needed/worked-before/awards intelligence works from day one.
- **Per-radio standard baud dropdown** in the Rig settings (1200–115,200) instead of free text.
- **Tune & Stop-TX controls in the Phone and CW cockpits** — a **Tune** button keys a steady carrier to
  tune an ATU or amplifier (auto-released by the TX watchdog), and **Stop TX** unkeys everything instantly
  (PTT, tune carrier, and CW keying). Restored — these were missing from the voice/CW cockpits.

### Changed

- **Fast dial tracking** — the rig's frequency is now polled on a short (~180 ms) sub-cadence,
  separate from the slower S-meter/mode/power reads, with transport-aware read deadlines, so the
  dial keeps up with the VFO knob (matching HRD-class responsiveness on Yaesu).
- **Mode changes keep the rig's filter width** — switching bands/modes no longer forces the rig's
  passband to its default (which was popping the Width display); explicit width changes still apply.
- **Logbook performance at 10k+ QSOs** — the logbook list is virtualized and its filter/sort
  memoized, so large logs scroll smoothly instead of lagging.

### Fixed

- **FTx Call Roster overlap** — need-chips (e.g. NewZone) no longer spill over the callsign, and the
  Call column fits longer calls like VE2OPR.
- **Settings-tab crash hardening** — audio/serial device enumeration is now panic-isolated, so a
  quirky/virtual device (some Flex DAX / RDP-remote-audio setups) can't crash the app when opening
  Settings.
- **Dual-radio CAT no longer dies on the background radio.** Saving a radio's config could leave the
  active radio and the monitored radio fighting over the same daemon port, so CAT went dead on whichever
  radio wasn't active — and flipped when you switched. The daemon port is now always re-synced after
  de-confliction, so CAT stays live on **both** radios in either direction.
- **Per-radio audio on rigs with a generic USB codec.** Two rigs that both enumerate as "USB Audio CODEC"
  are now listed as distinct entries ("USB Audio CODEC", "USB Audio CODEC #2"), so each radio can point at
  its own soundcard; previously both silently resolved to the first codec.
- **Radio soundcards that use 8-bit or 24-bit audio** (some Icom USB codecs) now open correctly for RX
  capture, TX, and the headphone monitor — they were failing with an "unsupported format" error.

_(Protocol decoders for a native FlexRadio panadapter and a per-radio native scope are in progress
behind the scenes; not yet user-visible.)_

## [0.4.1] — Phone / POTA / CAT punch-list

Field-test fixes and polish for voice/CW operating, park activations, and rig tuning.

### Added

- **POTA/SOTA logging** — a park/summit field in the log entry, an OTA column in the logbook, an
  activation mode that tags every QSO, and standard `SIG`/`SIG_INFO`/`SOTA_REF` ADIF.
- **Local POTA park search** — a bundled, refreshable park index for offline park lookup.
- **CAT tuning from the Phone/CW cockpits** — direct frequency entry, VFO up/down step tuning,
  RIT/XIT, and A/B VFO select (a Win4-style rig-control panel).

### Changed

- **De-FT8'd Phone & CW cockpits** — the top bar no longer shows FT8/digital furniture in voice/CW;
  each mode keeps its own controls. Sortable logbook columns; clearer hunt-chip visibility;
  smart-Enter QRZ lookup.
- **Smoother FTdx10 (and general rig) setup** — Auto-test seeds the detected model, with a callout
  when no model is set, and clearer rig hints.
- **Phone bandscope perf + clarity** — cached spectrum row, a you-are-here dial marker, a passband
  overlay, and honest labels.

### Fixed

- Auto-test wrong-model guard, park-prefill honesty, CSV BOM on export, and tuning-entry fixes from
  the review pass.

## [0.4.0] — band map, log stats, weak-signal CW, callbook photo, filter width

### Added

- **Vertical pop-out band map** — an N1MM-style frequency map of live cluster spots for the Phone
  and CW cockpits, colored by award need with worked calls struck through; click a spot to QSY to
  its exact frequency and prefill the log (including from the pop-out window).
- **Full-band activity strip** — a clickable spot strip spanning the whole band with a you-are-here
  dial marker; your licensed phone sub-band is shaded per US license class.
- **Logbook Statistics** — QSOs by band / mode / year / hour-of-day, top DXCC entities, WAS states,
  confirmation rate, plus continent, CQ-zone, and DX-vs-domestic breakdowns (cty.dat-resolved).
- **Weak-signal CW decode** — the decoder now gates on true SNR against off-pitch band noise, so the
  sensitivity slider genuinely trades copy against noise and the "E E E" storm between signals is gone.
- **Real CAT S-meter** — the Phone scope meter reads the rig's actual STRENGTH over CAT (S0–S9+60);
  shows "—" rather than faking a level when the rig doesn't report it or during TX.
- **RX filter-width control** — read/set the rig's passband over CAT from the Phone and CW cockpits
  (CW defaults narrow at 500 Hz to dig signals out of QRM).
- **Rig DSP toggles** — NB / NR / auto-notch on Phone and CW, plus COMP and VOX on Phone;
  capability-probed so only functions your rig reports are shown.
- **Manual split + sideband override on Phone** — one-click "work up N" split with an offset stepper,
  and a USB/LSB/FM override that reverts to the band-correct sideband on a band change.
- **Callbook photo + worked-before recall card** — the "B4" hint grew into a full recall panel:
  QRZ/HamQTH profile photo, prior contacts, distance/bearing from your QTH, and a same-band dupe flag.
- **Split RST fields** — separate Sent / Rcvd reports in the log entry (the CW decoder fills Rcvd).
- **Auto callbook lookup** — name/QTH fill shortly after you stop typing a call, no Tab needed.
- **Update check** — on launch (throttled to once a day) Nexus checks SourceForge for a newer
  release and shows a dismissible notice, with a manual check in Settings; it only opens the
  download page, never downloads or runs anything.

### Changed

- The redundant top-bar band dropdown (fed by the digital band plan, so a wrong-dial control on
  voice/CW) is hidden on Phone and CW; each cockpit keeps its own band picker.

### Fixed

- A periodic scope/passband stall: the slower CAT reads (mode, S-meter, DSP functions) are now
  staggered across poll cycles instead of stacking into one.
- The 4 m band (70.0–70.5 MHz) is now recognized by the UI band ranges, matching the backend plan.

## [0.3.0] — the Nexus transformation

**Tempo became Nexus.** What began as a chat-first app for the FT1/DX1 waveforms
is now an **all-mode amateur radio operations center**; the Tempo name lives on
as the FT1/DX1 chat layer inside it. Builds now ship as
`Nexus_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe` — the first versioned Nexus release.

### Added

- **FT8/FT4 operating tier with WSJT-X operational parity** — a five-phase
  program against a 207-row behavior matrix: the WSJT-X auto-sequencer state
  table (double-click semantics, sender lock, return-to-CQ, disable-after-73),
  early decode pass (11.8 s FT8 / 5.5 s FT4) + 2 s time-aligned late start,
  Split Operation (Rig / Fake It) with a single teardown drain, Hound mode with
  safe Fox-frame splitting, directed CQ, Tx1–Tx6 panel, WSJT-X keyboard
  shortcuts, F6 redecode, decode depth/passband controls, logbook hash-table
  seeding, Classic ↔ Roster layout toggle, and chronological bottom-pinned Band
  Activity with period separators.
- **Full WSJT-X UDP ecosystem surface** — outbound Heartbeat/Status/Decode/
  QsoLogged and inbound Reply, HaltTx, Clear, Replay, Location,
  HighlightCallsign, using the canonical NetworkMessage.hpp type numbers
  (pinned by test); JTAlert and GridTracker interop verified. Plus **Companion
  mode** (ride an upstream WSJT-X/JTDX decode stream) and a **rigctld-compatible
  CAT broker** so other shack software shares the radio through Nexus.
- **CW cockpit** — CAT (`send_morse`) and soundcard keyer back-ends, 5–50 WPM
  with on-the-fly nudge, eight token-expanding macros, zero-beat scope,
  automatic rig-mode policy, license-privilege TX gating, 599-default logging.
- **Phone cockpit** — live dial read-back, band-correct sideband policy, fast
  colored bandscope, spacebar/button/rig PTT with stuck-TX safeties, six-slot
  voice keyer (record/import WAV), crash-safe QSO recording, RF power control.
- **Needed board 2.0** — eight need types ranked by award value with a per-row
  **evidence line** ("heard by K9LC (EN52, 26 km), 4 min ago"), corroboration
  gates (near-receiver geometry, VHF two-receiver rule, Es-patch locality),
  persisted filters, atomic one-click work with cluster split-comment parsing
  ("UP 2" → rig split), and a pop-out second-monitor window.
- **POTA/SOTA hunter** — live activator spots, NEW PARK and BAND OPEN badges,
  one-click HUNT (QSY + cockpit + pending park tag with a 4 h TTL and base-call
  matching) writing standard `SIG`/`SIG_INFO`/`SOTA_REF` ADIF.
- **Field Day event mode** — ARRL FD + Winter FD with correct date rules and
  scoring (per-mode points, dupes per band per mode, legal power tiers, bonus
  checklist), all-mode event logging from the CW/Phone cockpits, band-follows-
  QSY, submittable Cabrillo 3.0/ADIF, **real-time N3FJP push** over the official
  TCP API (with Test button) and **native N1MM+ `<contactinfo>` broadcast**.
- **Logbook, awards & connectors** — ADIF 3.1.4 round-trip logbook; offline
  DXCC / Challenge / Honor Roll / WAS / WAZ from cty.dat; **source-aware
  confirmations** (eQSL never counts toward LoTW-grade awards); LoTW TQSL-signed
  upload + two-pull incremental confirmation sync over direct HTTPS; QRZ callbook
  autofill + logbook push + Test; ClubLog (bring your own free API key) and eQSL
  connectors; per-QSO upload state machine persisted in ADIF;
  prior-QSO history panel; credentials exclusively in the OS keychain; and the
  local-only **Journey** achievement layer.
- **Connect** — three-projection world map (3-D globe / azimuthal beam / flat)
  with 12 layers, intent presets, hover/click/double-click-to-work; an
  operator-anchored **opening detector** with reciprocity gates and Es/F2/
  aurora/tropo classification; band advisor; getting-out panel; NOAA space
  weather; and the persistent Now-Bar with feed-health pills.
- **Zero-config setup** — **Detect my radio** (USB descriptor → rig model +
  driver hint + paired audio CODEC), goal-driven first-run wizard, license-class
  transmit lockout (FCC Part 97 sub-bands incl. the 2026 60 m rules), DAG-
  validated feature registry, detached panel windows, NTP slot-grid steering.

### Changed

- **App renamed Tempo → Nexus**; repository moved to `kd9taw/nexus`.
- FT8/FT4 is now the production tier; FT1/DX1 remain beta pending on-air
  validation (unchanged honest framing).
- Field Log merged into the Field Day workspace; the Logbook is the single log.

### Removed

- **SuperFox** — investigated and abandoned: the WSJT-X QPC table file is
  licensed "only for use with WSJT-X", which bars vendoring. Hound remains.
- **Broadcasts section** — removed from the UI (the underlying announce/Roam
  machinery remains for Coordinated QSY).

### Fixed

- PSK Reporter uploads declared the mode string under IPFIX enterprise field 7
  (iMD — a PSK31 distortion metric) instead of field 10 (mode), so every spot
  arrived modeless and pskreporter.info displayed its default, PSK31 — FT8
  decodes showed up as "PSK31" on FT8 frequencies. Field id corrected to match
  WSJT-X's PSKReporter.cpp; spots now carry FT8/FT4/FT1/DX1 correctly.
- WSJT-X UDP message type numbers were shifted +1 for types ≥ 8 (a real JTAlert
  FreeText datagram parsed as HaltTx and killed TX) — now canonical and pinned.
- FT4 transmitted at slot +0.0 s instead of the standard +0.5 s timing.
- Split restore could strand a shifted VFO through the UDP HaltTx and tune
  paths; Rig split could latch VFO B.
- Field Day log band was frozen at event entry — post-QSY contacts exported
  with the wrong band and corrupted dupe checking.
- Winter Field Day date math used "last Saturday of January", a week late in
  years like 2026 — now "last full weekend".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-03

This is a **beta / pre-release**: everything below is simulation- and
Windows-cross-build-validated, **not yet proven on the air**. On-air
decode-rate-vs-SNR remains the open gate.

### Added

- **IR-HARQ is live end-to-end.** The incremental-redundancy retransmission
  combiner — previously designed-but-dormant (simulation-only) — now runs
  through the full live pipeline and is **on by default**. A frame that fails
  to decode standalone (RV0) is buffered and **joint-turbo-combined** with its
  retransmissions: RV0 carries the base 174 bits; RV1/RV2 each carry 87 new
  punctured LDPC(348,91) parity + 87 repeated systematic, each with a distinct
  Costas sync (RV0 `[0,2,3,1]`, RV1 `[1,3,2,0]`, RV2 `[3,0,2,1]`). Slot expiry
  30 s, freq tolerance +-10 Hz. A coherent CPM-Costas discriminator
  (`ft1_rv_detect`) identifies the RV (>99% accurate, <1% false to -11 dB),
  and the QSO sequencer drives RV escalation (0->1->2 on implicit NAK, reset on
  implicit ACK). Simulated (AWGN/fading sweeps): combiner **+1.3 dB** AWGN and **+3.2 dB** under
  1 Hz / 1 ms fading (3-TX); through the full live pipeline ~**+2.5 dB**
  threshold shift and ~**2x QSO completion** in the -11..-13 dB zone. UI adds a
  **HARQ.RVn decode badge**, a **HARQ on/off toggle** (default on), and a
  **session rescue counter**; `Decode.rv` reports how many RVs were combined.
- **DX1 full-passband acquisition.** DX1 RX now decodes **every** signal across
  200-2900 Hz per slot (like FT1's Costas search) instead of a single carrier
  at the tuned RX offset; `rx_offset_hz` is demoted to a waterfall marker /
  TX-pairing hint. Three-stage scan: a coarse chirp-correlation carrier sweep
  (12.5 Hz grid, pre-folded replicas, trig-free hot loop) -> median-threshold
  peak-pick -> full CRC-14-gated decode per survivor. ~3-4 s/slot.
- **Transmit period (Tx 1st / Tx 2nd).** Choose whether you transmit on the even
  ("1st") or odd ("2nd") T/R slots — like WSJT-X's "Tx even/1st". A top-bar
  toggle + a Settings mirror; persisted. (Two stations must pick opposite
  periods to complete a QSO — previously TX was hardcoded to even, which is why
  QSO timing "felt off".)
- **Click-to-tune waterfall.** Click the waterfall to set your **RX** audio
  offset (green marker); shift-click sets **TX** (red marker), with a **Hold Tx**
  toggle to keep TX fixed. FT1 transmits at the chosen offset and hears the whole
  band; DX1 decodes at your tuned offset. The waterfall now marks **real** decoded
  signals at their audio frequencies.
- **Live clock-offset check (NTP).** Tempo periodically queries an NTP server and
  shows your real PC-clock-vs-UTC offset in the top bar (e.g. "clock +0.3 s"),
  warning when it drifts past the slot tolerance. On by default; fails silently
  off-grid and can be disabled in Settings.
- **Operator manual + visual launch surface.** A full operator manual in
  [docs/manual/](docs/manual/) (Getting Started, Operating Guide, Rig & Audio
  Setup, Frequency Plan, Tiers, Building, FAQ, Troubleshooting, Architecture,
  Roadmap), a screenshot-rich README with a hero banner and an animated demo
  GIF, a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a `SUPPORT.md`, an on-air-report issue template,
  and enabled Discussions for on-air reports.

- **Tempo band plan + frequency controls.** Dedicated, US-General-legal and
  CW-clear calling frequencies across HF and VHF/UHF (USB weak-signal + FM
  simplex), placed clear of the FT8/FT4/JS8/WSPR/PSK watering holes and the FM
  national calling / APRS / satellite / repeater segments — see
  [docs/FREQUENCIES.md](docs/FREQUENCIES.md). New one-tap **band selector** and
  **manual frequency entry** in the top bar and Settings, retuning the rig live.
- **On-air operating controls** (from a WSJT-X gap audit): RX **input-level
  meter** + **Tx power** + **audio-device selection**; **Tune** (key a carrier),
  **Monitor** (RX-only) and **Stop TX**; DT-derived **time-sync health**; and a
  **Tx watchdog** auto-stop.
- **Windows cross-build validated.** All modem self-tests, `tempo.exe`, and the
  NSIS installer cross-build clean, and **5/5 Windows test exes pass** (FT1
  -15 dB, DX1 -18.6 dB, the 3-signal full-band scan, and FT1 acquisition +
  IR-HARQ `rv` through the C-ABI). Test exes now **statically link the gfortran
  runtime**, so they are self-contained.
- **Work a station + ADIF logbook.** Click a heard station (or a decode) to start
  a directed QSO with them; a persistent **ADIF logbook** (`log.adi`) that
  auto-logs completed QSOs and powers **worked-before (B4)** highlighting, with a
  manual Log-QSO form; inbound WSJT-X **Reply** (GridTracker/JTAlert
  double-click-to-call) now drives Tempo.
- **Live decode feed + alerts + comforts.** A color-coded WSJT-X-style decode
  list (CQ / directed-to-you / worked / new); **audio + visual alerts** on your
  call / CQ / new station; a **UTC clock** and great-circle **bearing**; and
  **editable quick-reply macros**.

### Changed

- **Starts passive (hunt-and-pounce).** Tempo no longer auto-calls CQ on startup;
  the presence beacon is an opt-in setting (default off), so the app listens and
  only transmits when the operator acts.

### Fixed

- **CAT now connects when you Save.** The radio loop read the rig/PTT config only
  once at startup, so choosing a rig in Settings did nothing until a full restart
  (and the VOX default never launched rigctld). It now applies rig/PTT/audio
  changes live — rebuilding the rig and launching rigctld the moment you save.
- **Test CAT.** New WSJT-X-style **Test CAT** button (Settings → Rig Control):
  opens the rig, reads its frequency, and reports green (with the frequency) or a
  specific error. A live rig/CAT status and an audio-device error are now shown
  in the app instead of failing silently to a hidden console.
- **Waterfall shows live receive audio.** The spectrum was computed from the
  decoder's once-per-slot frame (blank before the first decode, frozen during TX);
  it now reflects the continuously-captured sound-card input every cycle.
- **Tune** keys through the connected CAT rig (previously a VOX no-op on the
  startup snapshot) and auto-releases after 12 s as a safety.
- Installed app could fall back to the in-browser demo mock (fake stations / QSOs)
  if the Tauri backend wasn't detected; it now always uses the real engine.

## [0.1.0] - TBD

Initial pre-release. This is an **unreleased beta**: the protocol and tooling
are simulation-validated but have not been proven on the air, and the published
Windows binaries are cross-compiled. Treat this build as experimental.

### Added

- **Fast tier (FT1).** 4-CPM turbo modem with IR-HARQ, 4 s T/R, coherent.
  AWGN 50%-decode threshold of roughly -15 dB in simulation.
- **Robust tier (DX1).** Non-coherent 8-FSK with soft-decision LDPC(174,91),
  15 s T/R, fading-resilient. AWGN 50% near -18.6 dB with about a 3.7 dB fading
  penalty in simulation. Operator-visible tier toggle; the tier is never
  switched silently. Both tiers carry the same 77-bit messages, so all
  operating modes work on either.
- **Chat-first UI.** Vite + React + TypeScript desktop UI with three themes
  (Light, Dark, and night-vision-safe Amber-Night) and a modernized waterfall.
- **Operating modes.** Chat, QSO (run / monitor), and Field Day (run / S&P),
  driven by the headless-testable TX/RX engine in `tempo-app`.
- **Presence and messaging.** Passive roster built from decodes, free-text
  chunking and reassembly, a directed inbox, and presence-gated
  store-and-forward for off-grid nets.
- **Open broadcast and band feed.** To-all free-text broadcasts plus a band
  feed of decoded traffic.
- **Rig control.** PTT/CAT via Hamlib `rigctld` (launched by Tempo, default
  TCP `127.0.0.1:4532`), direct serial keying on the RTS or DTR line, or VOX
  for rigs without CAT.
- **WSJT-X UDP API.** WSJT-X-compatible UDP interface (magic `0xADBCCBDA`,
  schema 3, default `127.0.0.1:2237`; also listens for Reply / HaltTx /
  FreeText), with PSK Reporter spotting (outbound UDP to
  `report.pskreporter.info:4739`).
- **Windows installer.** NSIS `Tempo_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (per-user install)
  bundling the offline WebView2 runtime and Hamlib (`rigctld` + DLLs) so it
  installs clean and CAT works offline.
- **Build scripts.** Native Windows build (`scripts/build-windows.sh` for MSYS2
  UCRT64, with the `scripts/build-windows.ps1` PowerShell wrapper) and
  Linux/WSL2 cross-compile (`scripts/build-windows-cross.sh`), plus
  `scripts/fetch-hamlib.sh` to stage the bundled Hamlib.

### Known limitations

- On-air validation is pending; all performance figures above are from
  simulation only.
- The FT8/FT4 tier is Phase 2 — the internals are compiled in libft1, but no
  decode pipeline is wired up yet.
- Published Windows binaries are cross-compiled and should be treated as beta.
